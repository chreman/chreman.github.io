Together with [Stefan Kasberger](http://stefankasberger.eu/) we founded [openscienceASAP](http://openscienceasap.org/), an initiative to bring open practices into the education and work of students. Starting in Graz in 2012, we cooperated with various institutions in Austria on a range of workshops and lectures.
