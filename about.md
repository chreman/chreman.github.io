### About me

I [contribute](../projects) to not-for-profit/non-governmental organizations, whose projects circle around applying text and data mining technologies to help researchers and the public make the best use of the ever increasing number of scholarly publications.

I'm also active in the Open Science movement, and contributing to Open Knowledge and Mozilla Science Lab efforts to help open up research, and increase reproducibility and re-usability of scientific results, methods and processes.

Another interest is developing data science pipelines for NGOs working in the environmental or public health sector. If you have a specific use case or simply want to discuss an idea, drop me a line!

* Studying Environmental System Sciences (M.Sc) with a focus on Economics in Graz, Austria
* Currently Training Manager at [ContentMine](http://contentmine.co/)
* Research interests: Text & Data Mining, Scholarly Literature Recommendation, Environmental Economics
