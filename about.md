### About me

* Studying Environmental System Sciences (M.Sc) in Graz, Austria
* Working for [ContentMine](http://contentmine.co/) as Training Manager

* Research interests: Text Mining, Scholarly Literature Recommendation, Complexity Reduction

Right now working on a Master Thesis with the goal to specify and create an (open) dataset that may serve as a standard for evaluation of scholarly literature recommender systems.
I will try to blog about my progress here, and to publish other research outcomes as openly as possible.
