### About me

* Studying Environmental System Sciences (M.Sc) in Graz, Austria
* Currently Training Manager at [ContentMine](http://contentmine.co/)
* Research interests: Text Mining, Scholarly Literature Recommendation,

I [contribute](../projects) to a few not-for-profit/non-governmental organizations, whose projects circle around applying text and data mining technologies to help researchers and the public make the best use of the ever increasing number of scholarly publications.

I'm also active in the Open Science movement, and contributing to Open Knowledge and Mozilla Science Lab efforts to help open up research, and increase reproducibility and re-usability of scientific results, methods and processes.
