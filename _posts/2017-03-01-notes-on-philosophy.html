    <td>State of Nature</td>
    <td>"a state of perfect freedom to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit",
      <br>
      <br>a "state also of equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another, there being nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank" Treatises, Essay Two, Ch. II</td>
    <td>an initial equality of abilities of body and mind, "from this equality of ability, ariseth equality of hope",
      <br>
      <br>"From Equality proceeds Diffidence in the attaining of our Ends. And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which neverthelesse they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" Leviathan, Ch. XIII</td>
    <td>"In a state of nature an individual may himself enforce his rights, defend himself, exact compensation, and punish (or at least try his best to do so). Others may join with him in his defense, at his call.",
      <br>
      <br>"Groups of individuals may form mutual-protection associations: all will answer the call of any member for defense or for the enforcement of his rights." ASU, Ch. 2</td>

    <td>"we find three principall causes of quarrell. First, Competition; Secondly, Diffidence; Thirdly, Glory. [...] The first, maketh men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and the third, for Reputation. The first use Violence, to make themselves Masters of other mens persons, wives, children, and cattell; the second, to defend them; the third, for trifles" Leviathan, Ch. XIII</td>

    <td>Social Contract</td>
    <td>"And thus every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to every one of that society to submit to the determination of the majority,
and to be concluded by it; or else this original compact, whereby he with others incorporates into one society, would signify nothing, and be no compact if he be left free and under no other ties than he was in before
in the state of Nature."
      <br>
      <br>"But submitting to the laws of any country, living quietly and enjoying privileges and protection under them, makes not a man a member of that society; it is only a local protection and homage due to and
  from all those who, not being in a state of war, come within the territories belonging to any government, to all parts whereof the force of its law extends."
      <br>
      <br>"Nothing can make any man so but his actually entering into it by positive engagement and express promise and compact." Treatises, Essay Two, Ch. VIII
    </td>
    <td>"I Authorise and give up my Right of Governing my selfe, to this Man, or to this Assembly of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy Right to him, and Authorise all his Actions in like manner. This done, the Multitude so united in one Person, is called a Common-wealth, in latine Civitas. This is the Generation of that great Leviathan, or rather (to speake more reverently) of that Mortall God"
      <br>
      <br>"One Person, of whose Acts a great Multitude, by mutuall Covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the Author, to the end he may use the strength and means of them all, as he shall think expedient, for their Peace and Common Defence. Soveraigne, and Subject, what. And he that carryeth this Person, is called Soveraigne, and said to have Soveraigne Power; and every one besides, his Subject."
      <br>
      <br>Sovereign power in a Common-wealth can be established in two ways. One, a Common-wealth by Acquisition, through the use of natural force or war. Two, by voluntary agreement, a Common-wealth by Institution.
       Leviathan, Ch. XVII</td>
    <td>"two crucial necessary conditions for being a state: that it had the requisite sort of monopoly over the use of force in the territory, and that it protected the rights of everyone in the territory, even if this universal protection could be provided only in a "redistributive" fashion."
      <br>
      <br>"the self-interested and rational actions of persons in a Lockean state of nature will lead to single protective agencies dominant over geographical territories; each territory will have either one dominant agency or a number of agencies federally affiliated so as to constitute,. in essence, one."
      <br>
      <br>"Our explanation of this de facto monopoly is an invisible-hand explanation. If the state is an institution (1) that has the right to enforce rights, prohibit dangerous private enforcement of justice, pass upon such private procedures, and so forth, and (2) that effectively is the sole wielder within a geographical territory of the
      right in (1), then by offering an invisible-hand explanation of (2), though not of (1), we have partially explained in invisible-hand fashion the existence of the state. More precisely, we have partially explained in invisible-hand fashion the existence of the ultraminimal state." ASU, ch. 5
