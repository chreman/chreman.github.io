                          <p class="text-justify">
                          Currently I'm finishing a M.Sc. in Environmental System Sciences with a specialization on Environmental Economics.
                          From 2012 to 2015 I acted as a board member for a cultural open space project in Graz (Austria), which served as a local community platform for social-ecological-political discourse, sustainability-related projects, and art.</p>
                          <p>During my studies I recognized the need for increasing public access to knowledge, and the complementary need for tools that scale with the increasing amount of knowledge produced.
                            Around 2013 I joined the Open Science Movement, where both issues are being tackled - on the one hand by advocating for Open Access and Open (Research) Data, on the other hand by creating an open ecosystem of tools and services.</p>

                          <p>Machine Learning and Data Science are powerful instruments, but when applying them we need to avoid the "Type III Error" ;) , describing the situation of "Answering the wrong question", or "Solving the wrong problem".
                          For me it means developing tools in close cooperation with individuals and communities, thoroughly assessing their needs and then homing in on the issue that code and data really can solve.</p>
                          <p>I aim to develop software as a tool to empower humans with the knowledge they need. This also means working as open as possible, and making code, data and processes re-usable, adaptable and shareable without barriers.</p>
