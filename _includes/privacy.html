                      This privacy policy explains what kind of data I collect, what I use this data for and what your rights are. The terms used in this privacy policy for example “personal data” or “third party” are defined in Art. 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj

                      <h3>Purpose of processing</h3>
                      I use data for provision of information about my services.

                      <h3>Emails</h3>

                      If you click on the dedicated contact buttons your email software will be activated and invites you to send your comments to a specific functional mailbox. When you send such a message, your personal data is collected only to the extent necessary to reply. If you use your email software to send me a message, please be aware that the message you send is not encrypted by default. If you want to send me personal information via email I advise you to always encrypt your messages beforehand.

                      I will not forward your email or the data included in your email to any third parties without your consent.

                      If you have any questions about the processing of your e-mail and related personal data, do not hesitate to include them in your message.
