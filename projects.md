I contribute to a few not-for-profit/non-governmental organizations, whose projects circle around applying text and data mining technologies to help researchers and the public make the best use of the ever increasing number of scholarly publications.

I am also active in the Open Science movement, and contributing to Open Knowledge and Mozilla Science Lab efforts to help open up research, and increase reproducibility and re-usability of scientific results, methods and processes.
